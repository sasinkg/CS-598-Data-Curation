#### File A: `.txt`
This file pertains details about the inventory details at the car dealership. This `.txt` file has information on the car prices, VINs, engine type, color of car, number wheel drive, etc. It only has details on the car and nothing about the customers nearby.


#### File B `.csv`
This `.csv` file has tables set up describing the customer by name, address, sale date and whether they are a repeated customer or not. This file 

#### File C: `.docx`
This `.docx` file has information about the customer and nothing linking them to the car. This file only has details about the customer's name and address, and whether or not they require financing. 


File B seems to have combined the unique aspects of both File C (Customer Description) and File A (Car Details). This file combines information provided in both file A and C: Address and Name of customer, and VIN and other car information.
