# Assignment 1 Information

## Assignment 1: Data curation using the relational model
- Data curation is concerned with all aspects of data management required to efficiently and reliably support analysis and reuse. This includes everything from initial acquisition to organization, integration, access and preservation. Data often originate from a variety of sources and in different formats. Often curation requires the selection of a basic model for storage and organization and may require an in-depth understanding of the data and objectives for its use. The fundamental model we select and our design and implementation may support or impede our other objectives.
- In this exercise, we explore the application of the widely-used relational model in the context of data curation. This is not about learning the relational model or entity-relationship diagramming techniques---we assume you already have a basic understanding of these. Instead, this exercise is intended for you to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the relational model with respect to curatorial objectives and activities.  If you need a refresher on logical schema design or entity-relationship diagramming, see the Additional Resources section below.

The assignment is divided into two parts:
1. Data analysis and relational schema design
2. Data integration and entity-relationship diagramming

## Learning objectives
- Become familiar with data abstraction, indirection, and strategies for data representation using the relational model.
- Gain experience analyzing the characteristics of a dataset.
- Gain experience with documenting rationale for data representation selection, emphasizing relevance to data curation.
- Become familiar with ER diagrams and strategies for data integration.
- Gain experience analyzing the characteristics of data and integrating data sources.
